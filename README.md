# Udacity-Data-Science-Blog-Project
## <p>Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post 
## Introduction 
## Code

The code for this project is fully embodied in the **Permean Methane Rev 1.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook file
in this Github repository.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this project is from the NASA/JPL 2019 Methane survey performed with the AVIRIS team.
The Survey was done in West Texas in the permean basin and looked for methane plumes with infrared cameras.
Analysis of the raw data was done by the JPL team to identify source emission location and where possible equipment
types.
This data is public and available from numerous sources. 
It is available from NASA, but it is difficult to find. For this work I accessed it from the ACS
(see reference 2) at the following web addresses (also see reference 3 & 4):
	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00173/suppl_file/ez1c00173_si_001.xlsx
	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00173/suppl_file/ez1c00173_si_002.xlsx
 These are in Excel format which I converted to .csv format using Excel and saved in the Github.

## Rubric elements

### Rubric item: Code Functionality and Readability
	Code is readable (uses good coding practices - PEP8)
	Code is functional.
	Write code that is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary.
 
### Rubric item: Data
	There are 3-5 business questions asked and answered.
 
### Rubric item: Github Repository
	Student must publish their code in a public Github repository.
 
### Rubric item: Blog Post
	Communicate their findings with stakeholders.
	There should be an intriguing title and image related to the project.
	The body of the post has paragraphs that are broken up by appropriate white space and images.
	Clearly state the business questions and the corresponding solutions

### Installing
The jupyter notebook file can be operated with the standard Jupyter Notebook software.
As in all projects, it is recommended to set up an environment with the required packages. These include:
	pandas
	numpy
	matplotlib
	seaborn
 
A single notebook was used for this project: 
	Permean Methane Rev 1.ipynb
 
This notebook requires that 2 data files be present in the same directory as the notebook.
These files are:
	Georeferenced plume list ez1c00173_si_001.csv
	Georeferenced source list ez1c00173_si_002_clean_v1.csv
